## Line Follower Code Explanation

### Overview

This C code is designed for a line-following robot using the FRDM-KL25Z development board. The robot is equipped with infrared sensors to detect a line's position and adjust its movement accordingly.

### Code Structure

1. **Include Statements:**
   ```c
   #include <MKL25Z4.H>
   ```
   The code includes the necessary header file for the MKL25Z4 microcontroller used in the FRDM-KL25Z board.

2. **Pin Definitions:**
   ```c
   #define LED_PIN_0 (1U << 0)
   #define LED_PIN_1 (1U << 1)
   #define LED_PIN_2 (1U << 2)
   #define LED_PIN_3 (1U << 3)
   #define SENSOR_LEFT_PIN (1U << 5)
   #define SENSOR_RIGHT_PIN (1U << 4)
   ```
   The code defines constants for LED and sensor pin configurations to simplify the code and enhance readability.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```c
   int main(void) {
   ```
   The main function initializes the required peripherals, sets up pin configurations, and enters an infinite loop for continuous line-following operation.

4. **Peripheral Initialization:**
   ```c
   SIM->SCGC5 |= SIM_SCGC5_PORTB_MASK | SIM_SCGC5_PORTC_MASK;
   ```
   Enables clock access to the PORTB and PORTC peripherals.

5. **LED Pin Configuration:**
   ```c
   PORTB->PCR[0] = PORT_PCR_MUX(1) | PORT_PCR_DSE_MASK; // LED on PORTB pin 0
   // Similar configurations for other LED pins...
   ```
   Configures the LED pins as digital outputs.

6. **Sensor Pin Configuration:**
   ```c
   PORTC->PCR[5] = PORT_PCR_MUX(1); // Sensor left on PORTC pin 5
   PORTC->PCR[4] = PORT_PCR_MUX(1); // Sensor right on PORTC pin 4
   ```
   Configures the sensor pins as digital inputs.

7. **LED Pin Direction Configuration:**
   ```c
   PTB->PDDR |= LED_PIN_0 | LED_PIN_1 | LED_PIN_2 | LED_PIN_3;
   ```
   Sets the LED pins as output pins.

8. **Line Following Loop:**
   ```c
   while (1) {
       // Read sensor inputs
       uint32_t sensorLeftValue = (PTC->PDIR & SENSOR_LEFT_PIN) >> 5;
       uint32_t sensorRightValue = (PTC->PDIR & SENSOR_RIGHT_PIN) >> 4;
       uint32_t case_value = (sensorLeftValue << 1) | sensorRightValue;

       switch (case_value) {
           // ... Line following logic ...
       }
   }
   ```
   Enters an infinite loop where it continuously reads the sensor inputs, processes the values, and controls the LEDs based on the line-following algorithm.

### Line Following Logic

The `switch` statement interprets the sensor readings and determines the robot's action based on the line position:

- `case 0`: Forward motion
- `case 1`: Turn right
- `case 2`: Turn left
- `case 3`: Stop

Feel free to adapt and extend this code for your specific robot design and line-following requirements.
