Welcome to the Line Follower project implemented on the FRDM-KL25Z development board! This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources to build an autonomous line-following robot using infrared sensors.

## Key Features

- **FRDM-KL25Z Microcontroller:** Harness the power of the FRDM-KL25Z for precise control and efficient performance.
- **PID Controller:** Implement a PID control algorithm for accurate and smooth line following.
- **Infrared Sensors:** Utilize infrared sensors to detect and track the line in real-time.
- **Motor Control:** Achieve precise movement and adjustments based on sensor feedback.
- **Open-Source:** Explore and modify the codebase to suit your needs, and contribute to the project.

## Repository Contents
